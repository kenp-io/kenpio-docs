# Documenting the Simulation?

My blog posts weren't cutting it anymore for documentation. Now you can easily find instructions for your specific version. All the different projects are shown on the left bar.

- Project Source Files are on [GitHub](https://github.com/kenp-io)
- Support is on the [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/TMefY68JNp). Please note that it is read-only by default and you get posting privilege when you purchase something on my [shop](https://shop.kenp.io/).
