Ok, letâ€™s get started. It's very easy. To install the adapter you just plug it in as shown with the little arrow on Figure [1](#adapter_insertion). The only thing you need to watch out for is the orientation: the USB-C port is on the right (big arrow) and at the bottom, meaning closest to the mesh ear pads.

Now you can easily plug in a USB-C cable and start charging.

When you unplug the USB-C cable, as shown with the small arrow on Figure [2](#cable_disconnect), make sure to always hold the adapter with your finger to make sure not to damage it (big arrow on Figure [2](#cable_disconnect)).

To remove the adapter, hold it firmly on both sides near the bottom (dashed circles on Figure [3](#adapter_disconnect)) and squeeze with those two fingers while pulling in the direction of the arrow ( = the opposite direction of when you plugged it in). This ensures a uniform unplugging movement. Do not try to remove the adapter by prying from only one side, you might break the plastic casing.
