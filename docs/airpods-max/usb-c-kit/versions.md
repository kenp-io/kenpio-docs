All versions work the same. There are slightly different install instructions for each version though. Your version number will be written on the paper sheet inside your order.

* <b>v1.1</b>: Large majority of the kits sold so far have this version. It contains small improvements based on feedback from v1. The spacers have their tape pre-applied and they are now laser-cut instead of 3D-printed. The microphone holder comes with a thicker double-sided tape.
* <b>v1</b>: Only a few people have this version (for beta testing).
