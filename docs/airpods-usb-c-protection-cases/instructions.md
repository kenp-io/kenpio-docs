Ok, letâ€™s get started. It's very easy. You first start by inserting the bottom part while making sure the buttons are on the same side. It should slide in easily and click in the place near the end of the insertion. If you feel some resistance near the end of the insertion, slide the AirPods case out and check that the Lightning port is straight at the bottom of the protection case.

Align the front of top part of the protection case with the front of the bottom part and rotate the part in place while holding the front together.

Press on the down on the top of the top protection case to make sure the sticker bonds correctly. I recommend holding 30 seconds.
