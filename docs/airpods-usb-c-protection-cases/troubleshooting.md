# USB-C Protection Cases for AirPods - Troubleshooting
(last updated on 12.05.25)

This guide works for any generation of AirPods cases. 

If you have an issue where your AirPods are not charging through the USB-C protection case, please try the following things:

- Make sure the case is connected with the correct orientation as described in the [Instructions](instructions.md). Make sure it is fully plugged in.
- Check that your USB-C cable can properly charge another device. Let it run for a few minutes to check that the battery percentage increases on the other device. This eliminates the possibility that your charger or cable is faulty. 
- Disconnect and reconnect the protection case 10 times from the AirPods case. This could fix improper contact due to residue on the charging pins. 
- Disconnect and reconnect the USB-C cable 10 times from the protection case. This is also to attempt removing debris from the charging pins. 
- Inspect the female Lightning port of your AirPods case. Check for debris in the port. When you insert a Lightning cable, make sure it easily clicks in place and that nothing blocks it from being fully inserted.
- Make sure you have an original AirPods case. Fake copies are not tested and it could be that the pins in the charging port are inverted, making the case not functional in the normal orientation.
- While the USB-C cable is plugged in and trying to charge, slowly unplug the USB-C protection case from the AirPods case. There is a known issue with early models where the protection case only charges in a certain position (less than 1mm from the fully inserted position). This issue has been fully eliminated for units shipped starting Q1 2025.
