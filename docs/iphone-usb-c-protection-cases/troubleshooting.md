(last updated on 23.07.25)

This guide works for any generation of iPhone cases. 

If you have an issue where your iPhone are not charging through the USB-C protection case, please try the following things:

- Make sure the case is connected with the correct orientation as described in the [Instructions](instructions.md). Make sure it is fully plugged in.
- Check that your USB-C cable can properly charge another device. Let it run for a few minutes to check that the battery percentage increases on the other device. This eliminates the possibility that your charger or cable is faulty. 
- Disconnect and reconnect the protection case 10 times from the iPhone. This could fix improper contact due to residue on the charging pins. 
- Disconnect and reconnect the USB-C cable 10 times from the protection case. This is also to attempt removing debris from the charging pins. 
- Inspect the female Lightning port of your iPhone. Check for debris in the port. When you insert a Lightning cable, make sure it easily clicks in place and that nothing blocks it from being fully inserted.
- If you have a screen protector, make sure it is properly centered on your phone and not bumping into the sides of the protection case. This could potentially prevent the Lightning connector from being fully inserted.
