(last updated on 29.11.25)

This guide works for any generation of iPhone cases. 

## iPhone not charging

- Make sure the case is connected with the correct orientation as described in the [Instructions](instructions.md). Make sure it is fully plugged in. Don't hesitate to give the phone a good push.
- Check that your USB-C cable can properly charge another device. Let it run for a few minutes to check that the battery percentage increases on the other device. This eliminates the possibility that your charger or cable is faulty. 
- Disconnect and reconnect the protection case 10 times from the iPhone. This could fix improper contact due to residue on the charging pins. 
- Disconnect and reconnect the USB-C cable 10 times from the protection case. This is also to attempt removing debris from the charging pins. 
- Inspect the female Lightning port of your iPhone. Check for debris in the port. You can turn off your phone and carefully try to pull the lint out of the port with tweezers or a needle. When you insert a Lightning cable, make sure it easily clicks in place and that nothing blocks it from being fully inserted.
- If you have a screen protector, make sure it is properly centered on your phone and not bumping into the sides of the protection case. This could potentially prevent the Lightning connector from being fully inserted.
- Check that the issue happens with completely other power brick + cable combo, not just another cable.
- If you use a Samsung EP-TA800 charger, read the corresponding section below on this page.
- Try to unplug and plug the phone in the case while the USB-C cable is already plugged into the case and into the charger. If only this method works, please contact us by replying to your confirmation email.
- None of the above worked? Sorry for that! Just reply to your confirmation email by saying you tried all of the above points and you will receive further instructions.

## Data or CarPlay not working

- Start by going through the troubleshooting steps of "iPhone not charging" above. This will help make sure your case makes proper contact with the iPhone.
- Most of the time, this issue is caused because a cable that doesn't support data is used. To test a cable, connect your iPhone to a mac computer through the case. Make sure the iPhone is unlocked. If your phone shows up on the sidebar in the Finder app, it means the cable supports data and it should work for data transfers and CarPlay.
- None of the above worked? Sorry for that! Just reply to your confirmation email by saying you tried all of the above points and you will receive further instructions. Please also indicate if the charging feature works or not.

## iPhone sometimes disconnecting from case

- That sounds like a classic case of dirty Lightning port. The lightning connector is supposed to hold the phone in place even upside down without any lid on. 
- If it disconnects by itself it's likely due to lint in the phone's charging port blocking it from fully plugging in. 
- You can turn off your phone and carefully try to pull the lint out of the port with tweezers or a needle. 
- Disconnect and reconnect the protection case 10 times from the iPhone. This could fix improper contact due to residue on the charging pins. 
- Disconnect and reconnect the USB-C cable 10 times from the protection case. This is also to attempt removing debris from the charging pins. 
- If this issue still happens from time to time, instead of disconnecting and reconnecting the case, try pinching it from the top and bottom to plug the phone back in the Lightning port correctly.
- There's always a lot of friction in the pocket that can happen. So having to reconnect once in a while (maybe once a week?) is not impossible and not considered a defect. That being said, in theory, the case should never have to be unplugged.

## Case got wet

- If your case got excessively wet, do not try to use it to charge your phone. Some splashes are ok, but the line is if you feel like there could be water near/inside the ports.
- Remove the case from your phone, fully dry the electronics area with a hair dryer for 1-2 minutes, and then you'll be able to charge again.
- The case can't damage your phone even if wet. The worst thing that can happen is that the case won't pass a charge, which is then almost always resolved with the hair dryer trick.

## A plastic part broke

- Just reply to your confirmation email with a picture of the damage and we will do our best to find a solution.

## Samsung EP-TA800 bug

- The case has already been shipped to a few thousand customers and as far as I'm aware it works with 100% of USB-C chargers out there. Likely a few hundred/a thousand chargers have been tested so far. 
- There is only one confirmed issue (with solution) for the moment, the Samsung EP-TA800 charger. 2 customers have had this charger so far, so it's not a popular model but it's still important to document it.
- The issue comes from Samsung's implementation of their own "Super Fast Charging" protocol which doesn't like the custom electronics inside the case. 
- To use this charger to charge your iPhone, you'll need to unplug and plug the phone in the case while the USB-C cable is already plugged into the case and into the Samsung charger.
- If you have this charger or another charger that won't charge without disconnecting the phone, please reply to your confirmation email and we will find a solution for you.
