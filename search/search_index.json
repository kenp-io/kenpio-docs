We want to break open the white shell, kind of like a Kinder Surprise. You can use any cutting tool I mentionned above, it really doesn't matter. Don't be scared, you can't really mess this part up. Just watch out for your fingers. The only thing you need to watch out is that you need to cut along the middle of the shell, demonstrated by the red line on Figure 1. Don't go more than 1.2mm deep. It's better to not go too deep and than go over the line again if you feel like you haven't pierced the shell.</p> <p></p> Figure 1. Cutting Line <p>Use the metal spudger to help you breaking the outer white shell free. Once you're done, you're left with the outer white shell (Figure 2, left) and the rest of the AirPods case (Figure 2, right).</p> <p></p> Figure 2. Successfull cutting operation <p>On the back of the AirPods case, remove the two Phillips screws (Figure 3).

Pushing the flex <p>Now insert the metal spudger in the black area (Figure 5, top arrow) between the two plastic parts of the case. Make sure to be above the metal spacer (Figure 5, bottom arrow). Work your way around the case while not going deeper than a few millimeters. On the back, you can stop when you hit the metal hinge. We just want to remove the adhesive from that black foam above the metal spacer.</p> <p></p> Figure 5. Clamping Gap <p>Insert the metal spudger on the side of the case.

Button Insertion <p>While keeping the shell with the button properly aligned, insert the case assembly inside the shell. It should slide in without significant force. Turn your case around and check that the button stayed in its place.</p> <p>Now is a good time to check that everything works well. Check that the charging port is well aligned and that you can plug in a cable without trouble. Open the lid, insert the buds, insert your charging cable and check that the LED turns orange. Long-press the button and check that the LED turns white (lid needs to be open with buds in the case). If everything looks good, we are ready to do the final step.</p> <p>Clamp your case inside your vise, with the button facing up.

This is where you don't want to mess up. Again, we want to drill a hole in the white lower plastic part of the case assembly, but that's it, not further. The thickness of the white plastic is 1.3mm, so you shouldn't go much further than that. Basically just make sure you don't drill all the way through. </p> <p>Remove the case assembly from the outer shell. Insert back the nut from Figure 21. If you struggle to insert it, it is because it only fits with a certain orientation, shown on the left on Figure 25.</p> <p></p> Figure 25. Nut Orientation (left is good, right won't work) <p>(Optional if you have A1938. For A1602 you need to skip this.)

Power Board Removal <p>This step will be almost impossible if you don't have the right tools. I've tried removing the screw with the wrong screwdriver, ended up stripping it and wasted hours to get it out. Consider yourself warned. You need a T1 screwdriver that has a total length of 7cm or below. This is why I recommend using a T1 screwdriver tip (just the tip, not the whole screwdriver), because it is only around 3cm in total length, so it works perfectly for our application. The reason we need a short screwdriver is that if it doesn't fit fully inside the cup, the angle at which you will try to engage the screw will be too awkward and you won't be able to unscrew it.</p> <p>Remove the two T1 screws (Figure 10, big arrows) with the short T1 screwdriver as previously discussed.

Metal Lip Screws <p>We now want to completely remove the metal lip that was holding the Lightning connector. It is very firmly glued to the main chassis, with the infamous \"Apple Green Glue\". I tried applying heat to remove it, didn't work. A bit difficult to access with chemicals, so that left me with one last option; force. </p> <p>You need to jam a screwdriver in the charging hole. The screwdriver needs to have a total diameter smaller than the chassis (on Figure 11 in blue) and the tip of the screwdriver needs to fit inside the metal lip (on Figure 11 in gray). Thankfully, most small screwdrivers will work for this.</p> <p> </p> Figure 11. Metal Lip Detail <p>You can now secure the main chassis in a vise and carefully hammer down the metal lip. Watch out to not damage the power board that is still hanging (from Figure 9). Make sure to only hit the gray part! Here we really want to avoid hitting the blue part (that will depend on the colorway of your headphones).

Plugging in the UBS-C and microphone flexes <p>Now we secure the two B2B connectors we just connected. To do so, we take the smile bracket, make sure the black tape on it is facing up (and the padding is facing down) and place it through the 180 degrees loop of the USB-C flex we just created. It's called the smile bracket because it has a slight curve (Figure 18, left image) and it's important to place it so that the curve matches the curve of the power board.</p> <p>Insert and screw in the two T1 screws (Figure 18, arrows on right image).</p> <p>Slightly unscrew the screws from Figure 16, plug in a USB-C cable to make sure everything is lined up, and then tighten the screws fully (not like crazy though).

Make sure the gold connector is facing up (Figure 19, middle image). Push it as much as you can towards the charging hole. Also apply some downwards pressure to make sure the tape sticks to the USB-C connector. End result should look like the right image on Figure 19.</p> <p> </p> Figure 19.

To do so, remove the T3 screw (Figure 4, big arrow) and the T1 screw (Figure 4, small arrow). </p> <p>Remove the metal bracket that was underneath the screws.</p> <p>Disconnect the two B2B connectors that were underneath the metal bracket. (one connects the battery and the other is connected to a microphone)</p> <p> </p> Figure 4. Battery Connector Removal <p>Now we want to remove the speaker. It has a fragile membrane so make sure not to touch it or puncture it with your tools. When removing the next 4 screws, make sure to hold them with some tweezers while unscrewing them. There is a magnet in the speaker, the screws can get attracted and damage the membrane. We want to avoid this. </p> <p>Remove the two T3 screws (Figure 5, two top arrows).</p> <p>Remove the T3 screw (Figure 5, bottom left arrow). This screw has a thicker thread, don't mix it up with the other two T3 screws. </p> <p>Remove the special screw (Figure 5, bottom right arrow).

Speaker Removal <p>Remove the three T3 screws (Figure 6).</p> <p> </p> Figure 6. Battery Top Screws Removal <p>Remove the final two Torx T5 screws (Figure 7) holding the battery in place.</p> <p>You can now carefully lift away and remove the battery. The two cells (one on each side) are connected together with a cable. If you just want to replace the battery you can stop here and follow the instructions backwards. The battery is surprisingly easy to replace... kudos to Apple for once!</p> <p> </p> Figure 7. Battery Side Screws Removal <p>Now we want to remove the old charging port. Start by removing the two T1 screws (Figure 8, small arrows.)</p> <p>Remove the metal bracket that was underneath the screws. We will call it the smile bracket.</p> <p>Disconnect and lift off the two connectors. The one on the right is the Lightning connector, the one on the left is a microphone.

Lightning and Mic Connector Removal <p>Carefully slide the power board away while making sure it doesn't get stuck on the flex B2B connectors we previously disconnected (on Figure 8 and 4). The power board will still be connected with a cable (Figure 9), so watch out not to damage it.</p> <p> </p> Figure 9. Power Board Removal <p>This step will be almost impossible if you don't have the right tools. I've tried removing the screw with the wrong screwdriver, ended up stripping it and wasted hours to get it out. Consider yourself warned. You need a T1 screwdriver that has a total length of 7cm or below. This is why I recommend using a T1 screwdriver tip (just the tip, not the whole screwdriver), because it is only around 3cm in total length, so it works perfectly for our application. The reason we need a short screwdriver is that if it doesn't fit fully inside the cup, the angle at which you will try to engage the screw will be too awkward and you won't be able to unscrew it.</p> <p>Remove the two T1 screws (Figure 10, big arrows) with the short T1 screwdriver as previously discussed. Just rotate the tip directly with your fingers.</p> <p>Remove the two T3 screws (Figure 10, small arrows).</p> <p>You can now remove the Lightning charging cable and the microphone.</p> <p> </p> Figure 10. Metal Lip Screws <p>We now want to completely remove the metal lip that was holding the Lightning connector. It is very firmly glued to the main chassis, with the infamous \"Apple Green Glue\". I tried applying heat to remove it, didn't work. A bit difficult to access with chemicals, so that left me with one last option; force. </p> <p>You need to jam a screwdriver in the charging hole. The screwdriver needs to have a total diameter smaller than the chassis (on Figure 11 in blue) and the tip of the screwdriver needs to fit inside the metal lip (on Figure 11 in gray). Thankfully, most small screwdrivers will work for this.</p> <p> </p> Figure 11. Metal Lip Detail <p>You can now secure the main chassis in a vise and carefully hammer down the metal lip (Figure 12). Watch out to not damage the power board that is still hanging (from Figure 9). Make sure to only hit the gray part! Here we really want to avoid hitting the blue part (that will depend on the colorway of your headphones). The metal lip will just fall down.</p> <p>Disassembly is over, we can now install the USB-C kit!</p> <p> </p> Figure 12. Metal Lip Hammering <p>Place the power board back in place while making sure the B2B connector (Figure 4, small arrow) goes on top of the board.</p> <p>Stick the round spacer in place (Figure 13, right arrow). The color of the spacer might change (here is white, but it can be orange or blue). The tape is already applied on the spacer, you just need to carefully peel off one layer on the light brown side. You need to make sure that the spacer is properly centered and that it doesn't touch any of the surrounding SMD components. If you have some black residue on your fingers, it's just some burn marks from the laser cutting process, nothing to worry about. </p> <p> </p> Figure 13. Round Spacer Application <p>Stick the right-angled spacer in place as shown on the right of Figure 14. Again here, the tape is already applied on the spacer and its color might change.</p> <p> </p> Figure 14. PCB Spacer Application <p>Insert the microphone we previously removed inside its custom holder that is included in the kit. With the hole facing down (Figure 15, shown with the arrow), make sure the microphone PCB is inserted with the flexing part sticking out of the left side (Figure 15, right image).</p> <p> </p> Figure 15. Microphone Holder Insertion <p>Place the USB-C PCB while making sure the mounting holes are lined up with the holes of the power board.</p> <p>Insert and screw in the two T3 screws (Figure 16, shown with the arrows). Do not screw them all the way just yet.</p> <p> </p> Figure 16. Securing the USB-C PCB <p>We want to connect the flex PCB we just secured in place to the mainboard. To do so, bend the flexible part so that it rotates 180 degrees and connect it to the mainboard by pressing it down with some tweezers (Figure 17, left image).</p> <p>Connect the microphone back to the mainboard while making sure the flex part is pointing in the direction of the charging hole (Figure 17, right image).</p> <p> </p> Figure 17. Plugging in the UBS-C and microphone flexes <p>Now we secure the two B2B connectors we just connected. To do so, we take the smile bracket, make sure the black tape on it is facing up (and the padding is facing down) and place it through the 180 degrees loop of the USB-C flex we just created. It's called the smile bracket because it has a slight curve (Figure 18, left image) and it's important to place it so that the curve matches the curve of the power board.</p> <p>Insert and screw in the two T1 screws (Figure 18, arrows on right image).</p> <p>Slightly unscrew the screws from Figure 16, plug in a USB-C cable to make sure everything is lined up, and then tighten the screws fully (not like crazy though). This will make sure the USB-C connector lines up correctly with the hole in the main chassis. </p> <p> </p> Figure 18. Smile Bracket Placement <p>Take the small piece of tape included in the kit (it's rectangular), peel off one protective layer, and apply it on the bottom of the microphone holder (Figure 19, left image). Remove the second brown protective layer to exposive the sticky side.</p> <p>Then insert the microphone holder in between the USB-C connector and the main chassis. Make sure the gold connector is facing up (Figure 19, middle image). Push it as much as you can towards the charging hole. Also apply some downwards pressure to make sure the tape sticks to the USB-C connector. End result should look like the right image on Figure 19.</p> <p> </p> Figure 19. Microphone Placement <p>You're almost there! We just want to reassemble the last few pieces, should be very very easy.</p> <p>Place the battery back in place. Screw in the two Torx T5 screws from Figure 7.</p> <p>Screw back in the three T3 screws from Figure 6.</p> <p>Place the speaker back in place. Make sure that golden pins underneath are on the same side where the pins of the power board are. </p> <p>Here is a tip if you made some creases on your membrane. Take some tape and very gently pull the creases out (Figure 20). Works like magic! I even had some creases on my membrane even though it was untouched from the factory.</p> <p> </p> Figure 20. Speaker Crease Removal <p>Screw back in the three T3 screws and the special screw from Figure 5.</p> <p>Connect the two B2B connectors from Figure 4. Place the metal bracket back on top and screw back in the T3 and T1 screw (from the same Figure).</p> <p>Connect the B2B connector from the plastic cup. Make sure the orientation matches Figure 3. Place back on top the metal bracket and screw back in the T1 screw. </p> <p>Insert the plastic cup back inside the main chassis. Turn the four Pentalobe P5 screws in the opposite direction as the ones shown on Figure 1. They will only rotate about a quarter of turn or so.</p> <p>Insert the headband back in.</p> <p>You did it!!

Let me show you what we are trying to achieve. We want to break the glue bonds, especially around the plastic teeth.  </p> <p> </p> Figure 1. Front Teeth Location <p> </p> Figure 2. Side and Back Teeth Location <p>Clamp your case sideways, make sure you removed the AirPods buds and that the lid is open. We want to start closing the jaws to apply pressure on the case. </p> <p> </p> Figure 3. Side Pressure <p>That pressure will create two small gaps between the middle frame and the outer shell. Once you have a gap big enough to fit the guitar pick, you can insert it (Figure 4, small arrow) and slide the guitar pick on the side as shown (Figure 4, direction of the big arrow). This will break the glue bond.</p> <p> </p> Figure 4. First Guitar Pick Insertion <p>Now we rotate the case 90 degrees and clamp it in the vise. Make sure you leave at least a 10mm gap on top of the jaws (Figure 5, double arrow). Insert your guitar pick in the front of the device and slide it on one side as far as it will go (Figure 6 shows where you can stop). While sliding the guitar pick, I found that making a \"wave\" motion helped, I show this in the video at the top of the page.   </p> <p> </p> Figure 5. Clamping Gap <p>Leave the Guitar Pick inserted and squeeze a few drops of IPA so that it flows through the gaps you just created and let it sit for 30 seconds. After the 30 seconds, remove the Guitar Pick.</p> <p> </p> Figure 6. Corner Stop and IPA application <p>Insert the Guitar Pick near the LED and repeat the same sliding operation for the other corner. Squeeze a few drops of IPA so that it flows through the gaps you just created and let it sit for 30 seconds. After the 30 seconds, leave the Guitar Pick inserted.</p> <p>Rotate the case 180 degrees and clamp it in the vise.</p> <p>What we want to do is to keep the Guitar Pick in that gap and continue working our way to the back of the case. As soon as you can, you will want to partially close the lid and push the Guitar Pick behind the lid (shown on Figure 7). Go as far back as you can, then drop some IPA and wait 30 seconds. </p> <p> </p> Figure 7. First Back Corner and IPA application <p>Remove the Guitar Pick and insert it in the other corner. Repeat the same procedure to make your way to the back of the case (shown on Figure 8). Drop some IPA and wait 30 seconds. Keep the Guitar Pick inserted.</p> <p> </p> Figure 8. Second Back Corner and IPA application <p>Slide the Guitar Pick through the back of the case in order to join the other corner (Figure 9, direction of the arrow). Do not insert the Guitar Pick too deep in the case for this, as the Wireless Charging Coil is located right underneath the hinge. About 2mm deep is good. I found that rotating the Guitar Pick along its center of mass while having a forward movement helped to slide it through the back without going too deep. </p> <p>Remove the Guitar Pick. </p> <p> </p> Figure 9. Back Side Sliding <p>Rotate the case 180 degrees and clamp it in the vise.</p> <p>We will now lift the top assembly out, meaning that most of the glue bonds should be broken by now. If you see that a side is already lifting up, that's a very good sign. If not, it's ok, but the next step needs to be done with gentle force and control over your arm movement. If you try too hard to lift the assembly, it might suddenly lift quickly and you will rip and break the flex connectors. </p> <p> </p> Figure 10. Wrist Twisting Movement - Left Corner <p>Open the lid, grab it with your hand, lift it upward while twisting your wrist left and right. We are trying to slowly lift the left corner for about 1mm (Figure 10), then the right corner for about 1mm, then the left corner again for 1mm, etc. Go slowly and there really shouldn't be any problem. </p> <p>If you feel like you are applying too much force, start the tutorial over and this time you can go a little deeper with the Guitar Pick in order to further break down the glue bonds. </p> <p>Slowly lift the top assembly out, revealing the two B2B (board-to-board) connectors and flex cables.</p> <p> </p> Figure 11. Lightning and Wireless Charging flex cables <p>(Optional) Heat up the glue around the two B2B connectors. If you can control the temperature, do not go above 120 degrees Celsius for about 45 seconds. This will help for the next step.</p> <p>Use tweezers or any other prying tool to disconnect the two B2B connectors (Figure 12). Watch out for the small SMD components soldered on the mainboard next to those connectors, you do not want to rip them off.</p> <p> </p> Figure 13. Lightning (bottom) and Wireless Charging (top) B2B connectors <p>We now have the bottom shell separated. </p> <p>We can remove the two Torx T4 screws holding the Lightning connector (Figure 13, single arrows). The connector is weakly held by glue and you can just push it back and forth (Figure 13, motion shown by double arrow) to remove it. </p> <p> </p> Figure 13. Torx Screws and Wiggle Motion <p>Unglue the LED from the Outer Shell (Figure 14)</p> <p> </p> Figure 14. LED Removal <p>You can now completely remove the Lightning connector from the Outer Shell.</p> <p>Push the bottom metal slot out with your screwdriver (motion shown on Figure 15). </p> <p> </p> Figure 15. Metal Slot Removal <p>Now we install the new USB-C connector. </p> <p>We start by bending it correctly so that we don\u2019t have issues later. The LED should bend down (Figure 16, small arrow) and the B2B connector bend up (Figure 16, big arrow).</p> <p> </p> Figure 16. Global Bending <p>We also need to bend the flex cable near the B2B connector. There are two white lines on the PCB acting as guides (an example is shown on Figure 17, big arrow). You need to bend the flex PCB where those white lines are. The white line is always \"inside\" the bend. Do not bend the PCB completely flat, add a small radius to your bend. It might tear if you don't add a small radius to your bend. The final bend should look like an \"S\", and the connector should be facing out (Figure 17, small arrow). </p> <p> </p> Figure 17. B2B Bending <p>Place the Metal Spacer (provided with the PCB) in the slot at the bottom of the case (Figure 18). Optionally, you can use some of the red double-sided tape that came with the PCB to secure the spacer. Do not use more than 2/3 of the tape, you will need some later.</p> <p> </p> Figure 18. Metal Spacer Placement <p>Place the USB-C connector inside the Outer Shell while making sure the B2B connector is facing where the hinge slot is located and the LED is facing the other side (where the LED hole is). This is why we bent the connector on Figure 16.</p> <p>Add the two Torx T4 screws and screw them in about halfway. This is where the optional Magnetizer comes in handy. It makes it much easier to place those screws. </p> <p>(Important) Now, connect a USB-C cable at the bottom of the shell and then tighten the screws all the way. This is to make sure that everything is lined up properly. Disconnect the USB-C cable.</p> <p>Make sure the flexible PCB is straight, that the area where most components are placed is not bent (Figure 19, should be parallel to the red line). Please note that the need for this step has been mitigated since v3 because now the stiffener is present on the whole width there, so it is hard to bend. </p> <p> </p> Figure 19. Example of straight PCB <p>Place the LED inside its slot on the inside of the Outer Shell. You basically need to do the opposite of what Figure 14 showed you. You can use the rest of the red double-sided tape to secure it in place.</p> <p>Partially slide back in the top assembly and connect the two B2B connectors. Plug in a USB-C cable and make sure it is charging and everything works well. Do not go further if you don't see your AirPods charging at this point. If it doesn't charge, you most likely didn't plug in the B2B connector to the mainboard properly.</p> <p>If everything works well, you can optionally add some hot glue to the two B2B connectors (shown on Figure 13) to make sure they don't get disconnected in the future. </p> <p>Make sure the USB-C B2B connector bends properly (the \"S\" shape shown on Figure 17) and close the whole thing. The Wireless Charging B2B connector should bend similarly. If you can't close it all the way down, it's because the connector is not bending like the \"S\" shape, or because the PCB is not sitting straight (Figure 19) and is pushing against the battery. </p> <p>You did it!!

Side and Back Teeth Location <p>Clamp your case sideways, make sure you removed the AirPods buds and that the lid is open. We want to start closing the jaws to apply pressure on the case. </p> <p> </p> Figure 3. Side Pressure <p>That pressure will create two small gaps between the middle frame and the outer shell. Once you have a gap big enough to fit the guitar pick, you can insert it (Figure 4, small arrow) and slide the guitar pick on the side as shown (Figure 4, direction of the big arrow). This will break the glue bond.</p> <p> </p> Figure 4. First Guitar Pick Insertion <p>Now we rotate the case 90 degrees and clamp it in the vise. Make sure you leave at least a 10mm gap on top of the jaws (Figure 5, double arrow). Insert your guitar pick in the front of the device and slide it on one side as far as it will go (Figure 6 shows where you can stop). While sliding the guitar pick, I found that making a \"wave\" motion helped, I show this in the video at the top of the page.   </p> <p> </p> Figure 5. Clamping Gap <p>Leave the Guitar Pick inserted and squeeze a few drops of IPA so that it flows through the gaps you just created and let it sit for 30 seconds. After the 30 seconds, remove the Guitar Pick.</p> <p> </p> Figure 6. Corner Stop and IPA application <p>Insert the Guitar Pick near the LED and repeat the same sliding operation for the other corner. Squeeze a few drops of IPA so that it flows through the gaps you just created and let it sit for 30 seconds. After the 30 seconds, leave the Guitar Pick inserted.</p> <p>Rotate the case 180 degrees and clamp it in the vise.</p> <p>What we want to do is to keep the Guitar Pick in that gap and continue working our way to the back of the case. As soon as you can, you will want to partially close the lid and push the Guitar Pick behind the lid (shown on Figure 7). Go as far back as you can, then drop some IPA and wait 30 seconds. </p> <p> </p> Figure 7. First Back Corner and IPA application <p>Remove the Guitar Pick and insert it in the other corner. Repeat the same procedure to make your way to the back of the case (shown on Figure 8). Drop some IPA and wait 30 seconds. Keep the Guitar Pick inserted.</p> <p> </p> Figure 8. Second Back Corner and IPA application <p>Slide the Guitar Pick through the back of the case in order to join the other corner (Figure 9, direction of the arrow). Do not insert the Guitar Pick too deep in the case for this, as the Wireless Charging Coil is located right underneath the hinge. About 2mm deep is good. I found that rotating the Guitar Pick along its center of mass while having a forward movement helped to slide it through the back without going too deep. </p> <p>Remove the Guitar Pick. </p> <p> </p> Figure 9. Back Side Sliding <p>Rotate the case 180 degrees and clamp it in the vise.</p> <p>We will now lift the top assembly out, meaning that most of the glue bonds should be broken by now. If you see that a side is already lifting up, that's a very good sign. If not, it's ok, but the next step needs to be done with gentle force and control over your arm movement. If you try too hard to lift the assembly, it might suddenly lift quickly and you will rip and break the flex connectors. </p> <p> </p> Figure 10. Wrist Twisting Movement - Left Corner <p>Open the lid, grab it with your hand, lift it upward while twisting your wrist left and right. We are trying to slowly lift the left corner for about 1mm (Figure 10), then the right corner for about 1mm, then the left corner again for 1mm, etc. Go slowly and there really shouldn't be any problem. </p> <p>If you feel like you are applying too much force, start the tutorial over and this time you can go a little deeper with the Guitar Pick in order to further break down the glue bonds. </p> <p>Slowly lift the top assembly out, revealing the two B2B (board-to-board) connectors and flex cables (Figure 11).</p> <p> </p> Figure 11. Lightning and Wireless Charging flex cables <p>(Optional, but strongly recommended) Heat up the glue around the two B2B connectors. If you can control the temperature, do not go above 120 degrees Celsius for about 45 seconds. This will help for the next step.</p> <p>Use tweezers or any other prying tool to disconnect the two B2B connectors (Figure 12). Watch out for the small SMD components soldered on the mainboard next to those connectors, you do not want to rip them off.</p> <p> </p> Figure 12. Lightning (bottom) and Wireless Charging (top) B2B connectors <p>We now have the bottom shell separated. </p> <p>We can remove the two Torx T4 screws holding the Lightning connector (Figure 13, single arrows). The connector is weakly held by glue and you can just push it back and forth (Figure 13, motion shown by double arrow) to remove it. </p> <p> </p> Figure 13. Torx Screws and Wiggle Motion <p>Unglue the LED from the Outer Shell (Figure 14)</p> <p> </p> Figure 14. LED Removal <p>You can now completely remove the Lightning connector from the Outer Shell.</p> <p>Push the bottom metal slot out with your screwdriver (motion shown on Figure 15). </p> <p> </p> Figure 15. Metal Slot Removal <p>Now we install the new USB-C connector. </p> <p>We start by bending it correctly so that we don\u2019t have issues later. The LED should bend down (Figure 16, small arrow) and the B2B connector bend up (Figure 16, big arrow).</p> <p> </p> Figure 16. Global Bending <p>We also need to bend the flex cable near the B2B connector. There are two white lines on the PCB acting as guides (an example is shown on Figure 17, big arrow). You need to bend the flex PCB where those white lines are. The white line is always \"inside\" the bend. Do not bend the PCB completely flat, add a small radius to your bend. It might tear if you don't add a small radius to your bend. The final bend should look like an \"S\", and the connector should be facing out (Figure 17, small arrow). </p> <p> </p> Figure 17. B2B Bending <p>Using super knips (or something like a small pair of scissors), cut the PCB and its stiffener along the 4 red lines (Figure A1, left). Just make sure to not damage the flex part leading to the LED (Figure A1, arrow). We basically want to remove the parts of the PCB that are highlighted with the 2 red squares. The result is shown on the right of Figure A1.</p> <p>You don't really risk breaking something with this step because you are only cutting ground planes, it doesn't matter if they shortcircuit each other. This step is a fix to improve the connector alignment with the case. It is already done for you if you have v3.1.</p> <p> </p> Figure A1. v3 Stiffener Fix <p>Take one Torx T4 screw and insert it in the hole on the side where most components are soldered. The trick is is to insert it from the side and rotate it in place, shown on Figure 18. The PCB might bend very slightly so that you can insert it, but that's ok. This \"pre-insertion\" is necessary because we now have a stiffener and it will be too difficult to install this screw once it's placed inside the case.</p> <p> </p> Figure 18. Screw Insertion <p>Place the USB-C connector inside the Outer Shell while making sure the B2B connector is facing where the hinge slot is located and the LED is facing the other side (where the LED hole is). This is why we bent the connector on Figure 16.</p> <p>Add the other Torx T4 screw in its hole. Screw in the two Torx T4 screws about halfway.</p> <p>(Important) Now, connect a USB-C cable at the bottom of the shell and then tighten the screws all the way. This is to make sure that everything is lined up properly. Disconnect the USB-C cable.</p> <p>Place the LED inside its slot on the inside of the Outer Shell. You basically need to do the opposite of what Figure 14 showed you. You can use the rest of the red double-sided tape to secure it in place.</p> <p>Partially slide back in the top assembly and connect the two B2B connectors. Plug in a USB-C cable and make sure it is charging and everything works well. Do not go further if you don't see your AirPods charging at this point. If it doesn't charge, you most likely didn't plug in the B2B connector to the mainboard properly.</p> <p>If everything works well, you can optionally add some hot glue to the two B2B connectors (shown on Figure 12) to make sure they don't get disconnected in the future. </p> <p>Make sure the USB-C B2B connector bends properly (the \"S\" shape shown on Figure 17) and close the whole thing. The Wireless Charging B2B connector should bend similarly. If you can't close it all the way down, it's because the connector is not bending like the \"S\" shape.</p> <p>You did it!!
